# Run Notes

Codes and files in `local` contain summaries of the results generated by the codes in `cluster`. 
The scripts in `{forecast, heldout}/summary.Rmd` generate figures and tables reported in the manuscript. 

- data: this directory contains flow data, country name files, and other ancillary information used to generate/evaluate model performance/forecasts
- forecast/results: forecast summaries derived from individual trajectories generated by the codes implemented in `cluster`
- forecast/priors.Rmd: codes for inflow/outflow component prior specification using only pre-2015 data
- forecast/summary.Rmd: codes that generate figures, tables, and other metrics reported in the manuscript
- heldout/plots: summary plots generated from `cluster` codes; used for diagnostic purposes only
- heldout/results: summary results generated from `cluster` codes
- heldout/priors.Rmd: codes for inflow/outflow component prior specification using all available data
- heldout/summary.Rmd: codes that generate figures, tables, and other metrics reported in the manuscript
